    "* **Use Case:** \n",
    "  Implementation of an automated workflow for processing and classifying large batches of images.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Approach:**\n",
    "  Use planning algorithms like A*, Dijkstra’s, or heuristic searches to create a sequence of actions for pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification of images. The A* algorithm, in particular, can be utilized to determine the optimal order and sequence of these actions, ensuring efficient and accurate processing of each image in the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A* Algorithm for Planning:**\n",
    "   - The `a_star_classify` function uses the A* algorithm to determine the sequence of actions (loading, processing, and classifying) for each image in a batch. The goal is to minimize the total cost (time and resources) for processing all images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sequence of Actions:**\n",
    "   - Each step involves loading an image, processing it to extract features (mean RGB values), and classifying the image based on the dominant color.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Heuristic Function:**\n",
    "   - The heuristic function used in the A* algorithm estimates the cost to reach the goal, ensuring that the algorithm efficiently navigates through the sequence of actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Path Reconstruction:**\n",
    "   - The `reconstruct_path` function builds the sequence of actions from the start to the goal, providing a clear path for the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Image Processing and Classification:**\n",
    "   - The `RGB_classifier` function loads an image, converts it to RGB format, calculates the mean RGB values, and determines the dominant color. This function is used in the workflow to classify each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This planning approach using the A* algorithm ensures that the workflow for processing and classifying images is efficient, scalable, and easy to manage, making it suitable for large batches of images in practical applications."
